## Aviator Game Guide

The goal of Aviator is to withdraw your winnings before the plane
crashes. The plane\'s multiplier will increase as it flies, and you can
cash out at any time. However, if you don\'t cash out before the plane
crashes, you will lose your bet.

There is no surefire way to win at Aviator, but there are some tips that
can help you increase your chances of success:

-   Start with small bets and gradually increase your bet size as you
    become more comfortable with the game.
-   Pay attention to the plane\'s flight patterns. The plane will often
    fly for a short period of time before crashing, so it\'s important
    to be able to recognize when it\'s about to crash.
-   Don\'t be afraid to cash out early. It\'s better to take a small
    profit than to lose your entire bet.
